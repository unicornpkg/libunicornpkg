# etc-startup

This extra component runs all files in `/etc/startup`.

Where this component should be installed depends on the version of ComputerCraft:
* If running on 1.79 or lower, this should be placed as the `/startup` file.
* If running on 1.80pr1 or higher, this should be placed in the `/startup` directory (recommended), or as the `/startup.lua` file.
