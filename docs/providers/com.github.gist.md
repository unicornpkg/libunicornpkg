## `instdat.repo_owner`

The owner of the target Gist.

## `instdat.repo_name`

The identifier of the target Gist. (This is named this way for consistency with [com.github](./com.github.md) and because Gists are technically repositories.)

## `instdat.repo_ref`

The [Git reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) (a commit) of the target repository.
