## Through a datapack

If you want to make unicornpkg available on all computers, [there is a datapack available](https://github.com/unicornpkg/libunicornpkg/releases/latest/download/datapack.zip). See [this guide on `minecraft.wiki` for information on how to install datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/wiki/Tutorials/Installing_a_data_pack).
