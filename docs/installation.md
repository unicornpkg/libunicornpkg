# Installation

In this how-to guide, we will install libunicornpkg and the CLI tools onto a computer.

This guide requires access to the HTTP API.

1. Execute `wget run https://github.com/unicornpkg/libunicornpkg/releases/latest/download/install.lua`.
2. Add `/bin` to your `shell.path`. There is a script to bootstrap this, available by executing `/bin/hoof install unix-path-bootstrap`, and then restarting your system.
3. You're done! Check out [other how-tos](https://unicornpkg.madefor.cc/how-tos/installation.html).
